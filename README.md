# crypto-converter

# Description
This project is a simple currency converter that is capable of converting either fiat or crypto currency to other currencies.

# Getting The Project Working
To convert between two currencies, you need to change the function parameters in the app.rb file (path to file: currency-converter/lib/app.rb).

# Setting Currency Names
To check if your currency is valid you may check the currency.json (path to file: currency-converter/lib/json/currency.json).

# Plans For Future
Add a CLI to this project so that the user does not have to hard-code a currency every time.

Add more converting types (such as commodities).
